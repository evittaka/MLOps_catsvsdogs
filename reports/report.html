<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>50</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s233671, s233670, s232425, s242577, s180866</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework</strong> &gt; <strong>did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em> &gt; <em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the third-party framework PyTorch Image Models (TIMM) in our project, as our goal was to classify images, and this framework is well-suited for that purpose. We mainly used the package to load pre-trained models, focusing on the MobileNetV3 model because it is lightweight and suitable for team members without access to a GPU, and to fine-tune it on our dataset. The package allowed us to quickly start with a state-of-the-art model, saving us the time of building it from scratch and achieving better results than training from scratch, thanks to the pretraining.</p>
<p>In the beggining, as we were unsure on what we were going to learn, we selected this lightweight model. Then after learning how to use cloud services, we could have used a more complex model also from TIMM. However, as the results were good, we decided to keep the model as it was, as it was not the main focus of the project.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong> &gt; <strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em> &gt; <em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We manage our dependencies using <code>requirements.txt</code> and <code>requirements-dev.txt</code>, which were autogenerated with <code>pipreqs</code>. To set up the environment, new team members should begin by cloning the repository. Next, they should create a new environment and install <code>pip</code>. Then, they can use <code>pip</code> to install all packages listed in both <code>requirements.txt</code> and <code>requirements-dev.txt</code>. If the <code>invoke</code> package is installed, running the commands <code>invoke requirements</code> or <code>invoke dev-requirements</code> will also install the necessary dependencies. Finally, to access the data, team members should either clone the dataset using DVC (Data Version Control) or execute <code>invoke preprocess-data</code> to download and prepare the data for use.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong> &gt; <strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em> &gt; <em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em> &gt; <em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We started with a Cookiecutter template and customized it for our project. Here's a breakdown of the adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> We populated the <code>requirements.txt</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code> files with the necessary dependencies. </li>
<li><strong>Configuration files:</strong> We updated <code>.gitignore</code>, <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code>, and other configuration files to fit the project needs.</li>
<li><strong>Project structure:</strong> </li>
<li>The <code>tests</code> and <code>src/catsvsdogs</code> directories were filled with the relevant code and tests.</li>
<li>We stored the trained models in the <code>models</code> directory and the logs in the <code>logs</code> directory.</li>
<li>Dependency files were placed in the <code>dependency</code> folder.</li>
<li>The <code>dockerfiles</code> and <code>data</code> directories were also filled accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We removed the <code>notebooks</code> folder as we did not use any notebooks in this project. Additionally, we added an <code>artifacts</code> folder to store model weights and logs from our experiments. For specific utilities, we included the <code>wandb</code> folder for Weights &amp; Biases and folders for outputs from Hydra.</p>
<p>Overall, we made full use of the best practices from the Cookiecutter template, tailoring the structure and content to our project's needs.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong> &gt; <strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em> &gt; <em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we used Ruff to maintain good code styling. We implemented a two-step check process. First, as described in the README.md file, we ensure that all Ruff checks pass before pushing code to GitHub. Second, we set up automatic GitHub checks that verify the pushed code adheres to the Ruff requirements.</p>
<p>In larger projects, maintaining tidy and consistent code is crucial. Since many people may work on the same codebase, having a unified coding style makes the code easier to read and understand. Without a consistent style, the code can become messy and difficult to navigate. Additionally, tidy code helps new team members quickly understand the structure and get up to speed.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em> &gt; <em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 7 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong> &gt; <strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 8 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong> &gt; <strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em> &gt; <em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we employed branches and pull requests as part of our workflow. Initially, we experienced a major issue when a direct push to the main branch resulted in the repository being completely disrupted. This taught us the importance of using branches and pull requests for maintaining stability. We had to use git reset --hard to recover the repository, which was a valuable but time-consuming lesson.</p>
<p>To prevent such incidents in the future, we set up the repository to only allow pull requests to the main branch. Additionally, we enforced a rule to prevent anyone from approving their own pull requests, ensuring peer review before merging. Each team member worked on their respective feature branches and submitted pull requests once their code was ready. This process allowed us to catch bugs, maintain code quality, and ensure that new changes integrated smoothly without impacting the main branch.</p>
<p>By implementing this structure, we improved collaboration and safeguarded the integrity of our codebase, ensuring a smoother and more professional development workflow.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong> &gt; <strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em> &gt; <em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did make use of DVC in the following way: we set it up with Google Cloud Buckets as our remote storage for data. However, since our dataset was fixed from the beginning and did not change during the project, we did not rely heavily on the versioning capabilities provided by DVC.</p>
<p>In the end, it helped us in tracking scenarios where our processed data would change. This occurred primarily when re-processing the dataset to adjust parameters such as batch size or image size, for instance, to optimize model training or improve performance. By using DVC, we ensured that each version of our processed data was stored and linked to its corresponding configurations, allowing us to easily revert to previous versions or test alternative setups without manually managing multiple copies of the processed data.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong> &gt; <strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong> &gt; <strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em> &gt; <em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em> &gt; <em>here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 11 fill here ---</p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong> &gt; <strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We initially used Typer for configuring experiments, which allowed us to pass arguments directly through the command line. However, as our project grew in complexity, we transitioned to Hydra to manage all configuration files effectively. Using Hydra, we created separate configuration files for data, model, training, and evaluation. This modular setup made it easy to experiment with different configurations without modifying the code. Another benefit of using Hydra was the ability to log each configuration for each experiment, ensuring reproducibility and making it easy to track the results of each run.</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong> &gt; <strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em> &gt; <em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in Question 12, we used Hydra to manage all configuration files for our experiments, including those for data, model, training, and evaluation. One of the key benefits of using Hydra is that it automatically saves the configuration used for each run in a separate directory, ensuring that no information is lost.</p>
<p>Whenever an experiment is run, the exact configuration of all parameters is stored alongside the results, making it easy to track the setup that produced a particular outcome. To reproduce an experiment, we simply reuse the saved configuration file from a previous run. This feature allowed us to maintain a comprehensive record of every experiment and ensured reproducibility across the team.</p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong> &gt; <strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong> &gt; <strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong> &gt; <strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em> &gt; <em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>

<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong> &gt; <strong>experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em> &gt; <em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>

<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong> &gt; <strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em> &gt; <em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>

<h2>Working in the cloud</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the following GCP services in our project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Buckets:</strong> Used for storing our datasets and processed data. The buckets served as a remote storage solution, ensuring easy accessibility and integration with our version control system, DVC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VM Instances (Compute Engine):</strong> Utilized for running experiments and training our models in the cloud. These virtual machines provided the computational resources needed for efficient execution of our workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Build:</strong> Employed to build Docker images automatically. We set up triggers linked to our GitHub repository so that whenever changes were pushed, the Docker images were rebuilt and deployed. This streamlined our workflow and ensured that the latest code was always reflected in the containerized environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertex AI:</strong> Used for orchestrating our model training and deployment pipelines. Vertex AI provided a managed environment for training models on distributed hardware and for deploying our trained models as scalable, reliable endpoints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These services combined allowed us to manage data, compute resources, and deployment workflows efficiently, significantly improving our project’s scalability and reliability.</p>
<h3>Question 18</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs</strong> &gt; <strong>you used?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the</em> &gt; <em>using a custom container: ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used Compute Engine for training and experiments, initially deploying a <strong>T4 GPU instance</strong> in the South America region due to GPU unavailability in Europe. The instance was created using the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
gcloud compute instances create mlops-t4-gpu \
    --zone=southamerica-east1-c \
    --machine-type=n1-standard-1 \
    --image-family=tf2-ent-latest-gpu \
    --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \
    --accelerator="type=nvidia-tesla-t4,count=1" \
    --maintenance-policy=TERMINATE \
    --metadata="install-nvidia-driver=True"</code></p>
<p>Although lag was significant while working on this instance, we managed to run our experiments and training pipelines successfully. Additionally, we used <strong>Docker images</strong> to containerize our training environment. These images were built using <strong>Cloud Build</strong>, with triggers linked to our GitHub repository to ensure that changes in the codebase were automatically reflected in the containerized environment. This approach allowed us to maintain consistency between our local and cloud environments, facilitating reproducibility and scalability across different stages of the project.</p>
<h3>Question 19</h3>
